fix acceleration, have a current_speed and max speed
make turn_str change based on velocity

rails:
- momentum not carrying with jump
- velcoity constant, not based on players
- superjumping?
- how to get player velocity:
	- use the innacurate limit of the remote transform?


mailboxes
- skate near area and press toss button to deliver
- while aiming you can throw the mail into the boxes


TODO:
- mail goes away
	- when decay time reached
	- when it hits mailbox or level

- mail quota
 	- just count the # of mailbox nodes in the scene
 	- when more than half full let player win level

 - pits/respanws
 	- have a current respawn variable that get's changed
 	- a respawn is a position and an area ig
 	- when you fall in pit go back to last respawn

MOVEMENT MECHANICS:
- tune the movement 
- add a boost that costs energy
- air spin
- wall riding???
- use the innacurate limit of the remote transform to get the player's velocity?


NEED:
- fix rail dismount
- boost 
- score system, no miss multiplier
- make a ending screen that show's some stats (time, mail delivered,score) and make a letter grade

- ui connections

WANT:
- movement
- make movement not bad
- make rails not bad
- just... make the whole game not bad dude
- add other movement options
- add... slopes?, y'know there still aren't slopes right
